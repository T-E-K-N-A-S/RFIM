This project is to find the ground state and to show how ferromagnetic square lattice converts to paramagnetic square lattice with increase in magnetic disorder,and to find the ground state in random field ising model using min-cut maxx-flow theorem (push-relabel) and H.k clustering method.

Lattice size: 40 X 40
